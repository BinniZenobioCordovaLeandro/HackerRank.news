I own and prefer an SE.\u003Cp\u003E&gt;I do miss smaller phones, and especially a physical keyboard.\u003Cp\u003EThere&#x27;s these &quot;Clicks&quot; but it&#x27;s a rubber slip case that has an extended keyboard at the bottom. They&#x27;re pretty hideous.\u003Cp\u003EI also wanted a physical keyboard, so I waited and found on EBay a Moguls Mobile iPhone 6 Keyboard case, which actually fit the SE after I dremeled-out the camera hole a little! My rose tinted glasses were a bit strong though, because swype is faster than thumb physical qwerty.\u003Cp\u003EI fondly miss when HTC was making innovative devices, when everything was up in the air. I had the G1, a mytouch4g slide, A Samsung Galaxy S relay. All QWERTY slider phones and all amazing experiences.",
