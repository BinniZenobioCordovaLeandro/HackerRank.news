If a client can go offline for an arbitrary period of time, doing a delta sync when they come back online is more tricky, since we need to sync a specific range of operation history (and this needs to be adjusted for specific scope/permissions that the client has access to). If you scale up a system to thousands or millions of clients, having them all do arbitrary range queries doesn't scale well. For this reason I've seen sync engines simply force a client to do a complete re-sync if it &quot;falls behind&quot; with deltas for too long (e.g. more than a day or so.) Maintaining an operation log that is set up and indexed for querying arbitrary ranges of operations (for a specific scope of data) works well."

            "comment_text": "There are niche use cases where the former (work for days to weeks offline) are useful and even critical - like certain field service use cases. Surviving glitches in network connectivity is useful for mainstream&#x2F;consumer applications for users in general, especially those on mobile.\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience, it can affect the architecture and performance in a significant way. If a client can go offline for an arbitrary period of time, doing a delta sync when they come back online is more tricky, since we need to sync a specific range of operation history (and this needs to be adjusted for specific scope&#x2F;permissions that the client has access to). If you scale up a system to thousands or millions of clients, having them all do arbitrary range queries doesn&#x27;t scale well. For this reason I&#x27;ve seen sync engines simply force a client to do a complete re-sync if it &quot;falls behind&quot; with deltas for too long (e.g. more than a day or so.) Maintaining an operation log that is set up and indexed for querying arbitrary ranges of operations (for a specific scope of data) works well.",
